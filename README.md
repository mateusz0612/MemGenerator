## Meme Generator

Meme generator built using VanillaJS/HTML/CSS done using Imgflip API.

## Features
- User can choose meme from meme list./
- User can enter his meme text into inputs (Inputs are added dynamically based on meme text areas)./
- User can create meme and see him on site.

## Reflections

I learned how to use things like classes, constructors (OOP) and how to create POST request using Fetch.
